## What is Wireframing?

**Wireframing** is the process of creating a simplified visual guide that outlines the structure and layout of a web page or application. It focuses on content placement, navigation flow, and user interactions â€” without including design elements like colors or images.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing plays a crucial role in product design for several reasons:

- **Clarifies Structure**: Helps define the layout and hierarchy of elements before diving into visuals.
- **Saves Time**: Allows quick iteration and feedback during the early stages of development.
- **Enhances Collaboration**: Acts as a communication bridge between designers, developers, and stakeholders.
- **Reduces Risk**: Identifies potential usability issues early, reducing costly changes later.

Wireframes serve as the blueprint for your project, ensuring that functionality and user experience are considered before any code is written.

##cKey Elements in a Wireframe
- **Layout Structure:** Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.
- **Navigation:** Shows how users will move through the site or application.
- **Content Placement:** Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.
- **Functionality:** Outlines key functionalities and interactions.
